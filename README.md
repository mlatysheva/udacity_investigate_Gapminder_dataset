## Introduction

This is the second project in the **Udacity Data Analyst Nanodgree** course.

The purpose of the proejct is to investigate a dataset, including:
- choosing a dataset
- posing questions to answer
- wrangling data and cleaning the dataset
- analysing data
- drawing conclusions

In this report I will analyse the following **Gapminder datasets** showing developmnet of the countries over a period of time:
- GNI per Capita based on purchasing power parity in international USD
- Life expectancy in years
- Population growth as % to the previous year
- Inequality index, % of 100%
- Human development index, % of 100%
- Democracy index, % of 100%
- Government military spending, % of GDP
- Corruption perception index, % of 100%

I will use this data to answer the following questions about economic and social development of the world:
<ul>
<li>**Question 1:** What changes can be generally seen in the development of Gapminder indicators in 2018 compared to 2010?</li>

<li>**Question 2:** Are there tentative correlations between the following indicators: life expectancy, level of democracy, level of corruption and GDP per capita, human development and democracy, democracy and inequality?</li>

<li>**Question 3:**  How is the income distributed in the world?</li>
</ul>

The analysed questions are listed in detail in the introduction to the Explanatory Data Analysis.
    
For the analysis I will take only data for 2010 and 2018. For some datasets the information for these years is not available. In these cases I will use the closest year for which there is information available.

In some parts of the analysis I will pay special attention to the following three countries that are of most interest to me:
- Russia (my motherland)
- Germany (the country where I currently live)
- United States (the country where I spent a year long ago)
